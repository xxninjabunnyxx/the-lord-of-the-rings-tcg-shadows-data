{"title":"A Shadow Rises (11R216)","text":"Set:\tShadows\nKind:\tShadow\nCulture:\tWraith\nTwilight:\t0\nCard Type:\tCondition • Support Area\nGame Text:\tManeuver: Remove (5) to make this condition a fierce [Wraith] minion until the start of the regroup phase that has 10 strength and 3 vitality, and cannot bear other cards. This card is still a condition. At the start of the regroup phase, remove all tokens from here.\nRarity:\tR\nNotes:\tWhen you make this card a minion, move it out of your support area. When this card is no longer a minion, move it back to your support area. For example: if a character bearing Phial of Galadriel, Starglass is skirmishing A Shadow Rises and discards the Phial of Galadriel, A Shadow Rises loses “Fierce” and can bear other cards. If A Shadow Rises bears cards when its maneuver special ability is used, those cards are discarded.","scanUrl":"https://lotrtcgwiki.com/wiki/_media/cards:lotr11216.jpg"}
